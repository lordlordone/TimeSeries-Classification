Once all possible outliers are detected, the outlier values are replaced through interpolation. It is possible to avoid this transformation on specific feature, to do so, there is ```ignored_indices``` parameter, which allows to take off them temporarlly and add them again at the end of the trasfromation. Example below:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "O = OutlierEliminator(ignored_indices = [0, 1]) # 0-th and 1-st columns are unchanged\n",
        "x, _ = O.fit_trasform(x)\n",
        "```"

Initially, the dataset is divided using a standard hold-out method, allocating 15% of the training data for validation. After identifying the best configuration, the model undergoes a thorough evaluation using k-fold cross-validation (as detailed in the Cross-Validation section) to ensure robustness, and its final performance is assessed on the designated test set (refer to the Model Evaluation section)."
